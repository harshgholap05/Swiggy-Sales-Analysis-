# Swiggy Sales Analysis

## 📌 Project Description (for GitHub / README)

### Swiggy Sales & Performance Analysis using Python and Data Visualization

This project focuses on analyzing Swiggy food delivery data to gain meaningful business insights related to sales performance, customer behavior, and regional trends. The goal is to transform raw order-level data into clear, actionable insights that can help stakeholders understand revenue patterns, customer satisfaction, and operational performance.

The dataset includes key attributes such as order dates, sales amount (₹), ratings, food type (Veg / Non-Veg), city, state, and order volume. Using **Python**, the data is cleaned, processed, and analyzed with libraries like **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn** and Plotly.Express. Missing values, incorrect data types, and inconsistencies are handled to ensure accurate analysis.
